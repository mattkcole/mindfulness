# Mindfulness

Welcome to the mindfulness Shiny app, an Audio tracking web application powered by R/Shiny, and built by [Sarah Salter](https://github.com/sarahsalter) & Matt Cole.
 

Our application provides a convenient way for patients to access wellness audio files and provides use measurement for researchers. 

You may access the live site: 

# Get started

To get started, go ahead and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mattkcole/mindfulness.git`


You will also need to obtain the media files from dropbox, (download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fbmgp84m8wohkev/AACOnzNsbsI1kNxT63L5m6Dya?dl=0)* and place all .mp3 and .gif files into the `~/www` sub directory)

Load shiny, `library('shiny')` and run the app with `runApp()`

You will be prompted to log in,
You may use the Username / Password combination "John" - "John" to log in as a User or the combination 'Nattyboh' - '12345678' to log in as an administrator. 

User activity will be logged [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WjhTKefPh821hn7Cr00rCyD3kXWwjRsjsYCqcjzDp8/edit?usp=sharing):

NOTE: Users do not need read or write access for data to be collected, as the data collection process is proxied through Google forms.

# Capabilities 

## Login

Log in capabilities are provided in order to
* Restrict access to only those intended to use the application
* Record who is using the application

## Security


Passwords are encrypted using the MD5 hash function and non-administrators will not be able to see the data being collected.


## Recording

Activity on the site will be logged, including which audio files were interacted with, exactly when the files and whom interacted with the files. This is done so in a way that protects data integrity through lack of data access permissions given to non-admin users (they have no access to the Google sheet).

## Visualization

The admin dashboard provides an overview of the activity occurring on the site.






\* Working on a more programmatic way to download data
